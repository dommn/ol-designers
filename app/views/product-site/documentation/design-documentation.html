      <p class="govuk-body">We’ve created designs to help you incorporate GOV.UK One Login into your service.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The aim is to provide a consistent experience for users across all services that use GOV.UK One Login, and reduce duplication of effort by services.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">However, you’ll need to tailor them to your service. You do not have to use them at all if research shows something else works better for you.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we created our recommendations</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The designs all use existing components from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk">GOV.UK Design System</a>.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">As this is a new type of journey, we’ve combined those components in new ways. We’ll be sharing our findings with the GOV.UK Design System team.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The designs have all been tested with users. Contact us if you’d like more details on the research.</p>
