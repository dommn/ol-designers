          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-4">Your user begins their journey on your service’s start page, usually on GOV.UK. They create a GOV.UK One Login using their email address, a password and two-factor authentication. 
            Then, they’re sent to your service to complete their journey.</p>

          <p>This option is usually best for your service, if you need all your users to create a GOV.UK One Login before they can do anything.</p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="create-save-progress">Create a GOV.UK One Login or let your user sign in with an existing one to save their progress</h3>

          <p>This journey shows a user creating a GOV.UK One Login in the middle of your service journey. This allows them to save and continue later.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-4">Users start at your service’s start page, usually on GOV.UK. They complete part of your journey, then decide they want to finish it later.</p>

          <p>To save their progress, they create a GOV.UK One Login using their email address, a password and two-factor authentication.</p>

          <p>Later, they return to your service and resume their journey by signing in to their GOV.UK One Login.</p>

          <p>This option is usually best for your service if you do not need all your users to create a GOV.UK One Login, but want to give them the option of saving their progress.</p>
